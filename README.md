It stands for Plant Management System. What else would it stand for? 

Essentially, we wanted to make an app that takes your plant, identifies it, and gives you advice on how to take care of it. The app will send you notifications on when to water your plant, if you need to move it, if you need to take it outside, or if you're drowning it.

We used Google AutoML Vision to identify the plants from a small database of images of succulents, and made it so that we could Google how to take care of the plants. In the thirty-six hours we were given, we have trained the AutoML Vision service to recognize three different kinds of succulents. From this, we had the app Google search for how to take care of each plant.

We used Udacity to learn how to code the app in Android Studio to work on an Android device.
